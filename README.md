# Text-Processing-NLP

Text processing is the automated process of analyzing and sorting unstructured text data to gain valuable insights. Using natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning, subfields of artificial intelligence, text processing tools are able to automatically understand human language and extract value from text data.

At the heart of text processing are math and statistics. From frequency distribution, collocation, concordance, and TF-IDF, you can make use of all these statistical methods to process and analyze text.

The task is to check Password strength using Logistic Regression ML Model. For Processing the text data I've used TF-IDF which is a NLP technique to Preprocess the text data into vectors for ML models. It shows three values(0 , 1 , 2) i.e. 0 for weak, 1 for medium, 2 for strong. Strength of the password based on rules(such as containing digits, special symbols , etc.)
